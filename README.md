# negative-harmony
It's a java program that takes a midi file as input file, and outputs another file which is the "negative harmony" counterpart of the first file, or its "mirror harmony" counterpart. Negative harmony can have multiple interpretations, so the java implements multiple ways to create the output file. It also implements the Krumhansl-Schmuckler key-detection algorithm which can be found here: http://rnhart.net/articles/key-finding/
